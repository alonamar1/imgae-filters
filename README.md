This project is an Advanced Image Editing Tool that allows users to apply a customizable sequence of filters and adjustments (such as brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpening, blurring, and edge detection) to an image based on instructions provided in a structured JSON configuration file.

The tool is fully runnable from the command line and is designed with a modular architecture to make it easy to extend with new filters and features. All image processing operations (like convolutions and kernels) are implemented from scratch, without using external image processing libraries.
